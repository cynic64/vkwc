# vkwc
A Vulkan-based wayland compositor with the ability to arbitrarily rotate and translate windows in 3D and apply all kinds of weird effects.

It used to have a physics simulation, but I took it out for now. I'll reimplement it eventuallyâ„¢ ;).

# Compiling
I wouldn't bother trying, this is a ridiculously hacky codebase that's meant more for me to experiment than anything else. If you really want to suffer, go ahead!

```
meson build/
ninja -C build
build/vkwc
```

Run it inside a compositor like Sway, otherwise it'll probably hang and you'll have to hard reboot your system.

I build it with wlroots 0.16.2.
